##  Introduction

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

In the data cleansing phase, We attempted numeric type conversion for all columns so that quantitative data such as year and tariff could be statistically analyzed, while retaining categorical variables that could not be converted. Double counting of data was avoided by removing duplicate rows. Finally, we focused on five key fields (year, climate category, climate region, length of outage, residential electricity price) to create an analyzed subset that retained some missing values to reflect the true data state. The cleaned dataset is ready to be used to explore the association of blackout events with climate/electricity price factors, as exemplified in the first 10 rows below:
